            With this sound, I was aiming to recreate a trilling bird call. Songbirds can
            create complex songs because they have a syrinx, which is like the human larynx
            but with two air passages instead of one. This allows birds to sing two notes at
            once and be very agile in their songs. To recreate this, I used to separate sources
            and put them through separate resonant highpass filters. I chose resonant filters
            to have the same effect as the vibrating membranes of the syrinx. For both tones,
            I used FM synthesis to produce two overlapping trills. The final result is a quick,
            two-toned trill.
